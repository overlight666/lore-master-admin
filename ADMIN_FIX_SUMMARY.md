# Admin Role Verification - Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
The AuthContext was causing infinite redirect loops because it was redirecting users to the dashboard immediately upon Firebase authentication, without checking if they had admin privileges.

## Solution
Implemented proper admin role verification before allowing access to the admin interface.

### Key Changes

1. **Created Admin Verification Utility** (`/utils/adminVerification.ts`)
   - `verifyAdminRole()`: Checks Firestore for user's admin role
   - `isUserAdmin()`: Simple boolean check for admin status
   - Validates against 'admin' and 'super_admin' roles

2. **Updated AuthContext** (`/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Added `adminUser` and `isAdmin` states
   - Modified `useEffect` to verify admin role before redirecting
   - Updated login function to check admin role and reject non-admin users
   - Enhanced with proper TypeScript interfaces

3. **Updated Layout Components**
   - **Dashboard Layout**: Only allows access if user is authenticated AND has admin role
   - **Auth Layout**: Shows proper error message for non-admin users
   - **Admin Layout**: Displays admin role in user profile

4. **Enhanced API Service** (`/services/api.ts`)
   - Replaced localStorage token with Firebase ID tokens
   - Added comprehensive request/response logging
   - Better error handling for authentication issues

### Flow Diagram

```
User Login → Firebase Auth → Admin Role Check → Decision
                                     ↓
                             ┌── Admin Role ✓ → Dashboard
                             └── No Admin Role ✗ → Access Denied
```

### Authentication States

1. **Loading**: Shows spinner while checking authentication and admin status
2. **Not Authenticated**: Redirects to login page
3. **Authenticated but Not Admin**: Shows access denied message
4. **Authenticated and Admin**: Allows access to dashboard

### Security Features

- ✅ Prevents infinite loops by checking admin role before redirecting
- ✅ Validates admin role against Firestore database
- ✅ Shows clear access denied message for non-admin users
- ✅ Uses Firebase ID tokens for API authentication
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Testing the Fix

1. **Admin User**: Should login and access dashboard successfully
2. **Non-Admin User**: Should see access denied message
3. **No User**: Should be redirected to login page
4. **Invalid User**: Should show appropriate error messages

### Environment Requirements

- Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- Admin user documents in `users` collection with `role: 'admin'` or `role: 'super_admin'`
- Proper Firebase configuration in environment variables

### Debug Information

The system now provides extensive console logging for troubleshooting:
- Authentication state changes
- Admin role verification process
- API request/response details
- Redirect decision logic
